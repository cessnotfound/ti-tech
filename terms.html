<h1>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>
<h2>INDIVIDUAL USER TERMS OF USE</h2>

<p>Welcome to Now Dating, operated by NOWDATING LTD (the “Company”, “Now dating”, “Now” or “Us” “Service”).</p>

<p>By creating a Now account or by using our service (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement and available through our Service (this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service.</p>

<h3>1) Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement</h3>
<p>a) This Agreement is an electronic contract that establishes the legally binding terms you must accept to use the Service. This Agreement includes the Company’s Privacy Policy and terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase or accept additional features, products or services we offer on the Service.</p>
<p>b) We may, at any time and for any reason make changes to this Agreement. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Services under Settings and also on Nowdating.io and you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Services or via email. If you continue to use the Services after the changes become effective, then you shall be deemed to have accepted those changes. If you don’t agree to these changes, you must end your relationship with us by ceasing to use the Services and terminating your profile and subscription with Now Dating.</p>

<h3>4) Terms for Now Dating</h3>
<p>a) Our service allows users to meet other users using your geo location, and time frame preferences (our services providing relevant meeting point venue).

In the event that it is determined that any of the information you have provided is misleading or inaccurate, we reserve the right to terminate your account.</p>
<p>b) Now dating was established as a platform for people who are serious about meeting other people, and we do not support untrustworthy or fickle behaviour.
